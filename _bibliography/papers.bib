  author={Kwon, Minseong},

  abstract={For each adjoint variety not of type A or C, we study the irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme which parametrizes all smooth conics. We prove that its normalization is a spherical variety by using contact geometry, and then compute the colored fan of the normalization. As a corollary, we describe the conjugacy classes of conics in the adjoint variety and show smoothness of the normalization. Similar results on the Chow scheme of the adjoint variety are also presented.},

  abstract={For a complex semi-simple Lie algebra, every nilpotent orbit in its projectivization comes with a complex contact structure. For each nilpotent orbit, we classify projective Legendrian subvarieties that are homogeneous under the actions of their stabilizers in the adjoint group. In particular, we present a classification of equivariant Legendrian embeddings of rational homogeneous spaces into adjoint varieties.},

  title={Algebraic hyperbolicity of adjoint linear systems on spherical varieties},
  author={Kwon, Minseong and Seo, Haesong},
  numpages={13},
  month={August},
  year={2025},
  abstract={Moraga and Yeong conjectured that for a smooth complex projective variety X of dimension n, an ample line bundle A on X and an integer m ≥ 3n +1, very general elements of the adjoint linear system ∣ωX ⊗ A⊗m∣ are algebraically hyperbolic. We prove the conjecture for spherical varieties with smooth orbit closures. As a corollary, we conclude that the conjecture holds for horospherical varieties, and for toroidal spherical varieties. Furthermore, for any spherical variety, we show that the conjecture holds modulo the complement of an open dense orbit.},

  abstract={Let X be the quintic del Pezzo 4-fold. It is very well-known that X is realized by a smooth linear section of Grassmannian Gr(2,5). In this paper, we prove that the Hilbert scheme of conics in X is a smooth variety of dimension 7 by using a torus action on X, which provides a more direct proof about the first named author's previous result.},

  month={February},
  year={2026},
  abstract={We establish a structure theorem for the connected automorphism groups of smooth complete toroidal horospherical varieties, that is, toric fibrations over rational homogeneous spaces. A key ingredient is an extension of the notion of Demazure roots from toric varieties to toroidal horospherical varieties. In particular, we provide a criterion for the reductivity of the connected automorphism groups of such varieties. As an application, we prove the K-unstability of certain P1-bundles over rational homogeneous spaces.},
