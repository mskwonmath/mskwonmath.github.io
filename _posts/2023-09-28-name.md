As one can find on the front page, I write my name as *Minseong Kwon* when I use English. But because I am Korean, my name is of course Korean, so in this post, I would like to introduce my name in Hangul and its meaning.

In Hangul, the Korean alphabet, my name is written as 권민성: 권 is my family name, *Kwon*, 민 is a part of my first name, *Min*, and 성 is the remaining part, *seong*. Its pronounciation is as follows:
* 권 sounds [kwʌn];
* 민 sounds [min]; and
* 성 sounds [sʰʌŋ].

The meaning of my name can be read off from its form in the Chinese character.
* 권 = 權 means 'power', 'authority'; this is my family name;
* 민 = 玟 means 'beautiful stone', 'jade'; and
* 성 = 成 means 'to accomplish', 'to achieve'.

So one may interpret my name 민성 as 'to accomplish valuable things'.
