# How to write it?

There are three ways to write my name:
* 권민성 (in Hangul, the Korean alphabet);
* 權玟成 (in the Chinese characters);
* Minseong Kwon (in the English alphabet).

More precisely, my family name is
* 권;
* 權;
* Kwon,

and my first name is
* 민성;
* 玟成;
* Minseong.

# How to pronounce it?

The pronunciation can be read off from its form in Hangul. My name consists of three syllables, which are
* 권 = Kwon [kwʌn];
* 민 = Min [min];
* 성 = seong [sʌŋ].

# What does it mean?

The Chinese characters represent the meaning of my name:

* 권 = 權 means *power*;
* 민 = 玟 means *beautiful stone* or *jade*;
* 성 = 成 means *to accomplish*.

So one may interpret my (first) name as *to accomplish a valuable thing*.
