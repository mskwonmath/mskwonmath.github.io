Welcome to the website of Minseong Kwon (권민성; 權玟成).

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Morningside Center of Mathematics](http://www.mcm.ac.cn) in AMSS, CAS. My research mentor is [Baohua Fu (付保华)](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/).

I received my Ph.D from [KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/) in August 2025, under the supervision of [Jun-Muk Hwang (황준묵)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng/sub02_02_03.do). In September 2025, I worked as a postdoctral researcher at [Gyeongsang National University (경상국립대학교)](https://www.gnu.ac.kr/math/main.do), mentored by [Kyeong-Dong Park (박경동)](https://sites.google.com/view/kdpark).

My research focuses on Lie-theoretic methods in complex geometry and in algebraic geometry. Nowadays I am working on the following subjects:
* Legendrian submanifolds of complex contact manifolds;
* rational curves on projective manifolds; and
* spherical varieties.

Here is <a href="assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_Minseong_Kwon.pdf" target="_blank">my curriculum vitae</a>.
