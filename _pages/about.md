Welcome to my personal website!

I am Minseong Kwon, a graduate student at *[Dept. of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/)* in *[KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/)*. I am also a student research assistant at *[Center for Complex Geometry](https://ccg.ibs.re.kr/)* in *[IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do)*. My Ph.D. advisor is Prof. *<a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng/sub02_02_03.do">Jun-Muk Hwang (황준묵)</a>*. I defended my *[Ph.D. dissertation](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/ko/schedule/scView.php?idx=-3577)* on April 3rd, 2025, and I am expected to receive my doctoral degree on August 15th, 2025.

My research area is Lie-theoretic methods in complex geometry and in algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am interested in
* complex contact geometry;
* rational curves on complex manifolds; and
* spherical varieties.

The following papers are now in preparation:
* Conics on rational homogeneous spaces with *[Nicolas Perrin](https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/nicolas.perrin/)*.
* Hyperbolicity of adjoint linear systems on spherical varieties with *[Haesong Seo (서해송)](https://sites.google.com/view/haesongseo/home)*.

Here is *<a href="assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_Minseong_Kwon.pdf" target="_blank">my curriculum vitae</a>*.
