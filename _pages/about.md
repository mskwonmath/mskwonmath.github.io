Welcome to my personal website!

I am Minseong Kwon, a graduate student at [Dept. of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/) in [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). I am also a student research assistant at [Center for Complex Geometry](https://ccg.ibs.re.kr/) in [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do). My PhD advisor is Prof. <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng/sub02_02_03.do">Jun-Muk Hwang</a>. I am expected to receive my doctoral degree on August 15th, 2025.

My research area is complex geometry and algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am interested in
* complex contact geometry of nilpotent orbits;
* rational curves on complex manifolds; and
* geometry of spherical varieties.

The following papers are now in preparation:
* Homogeneous Legendrian subvarieties of adjoint varieties (<a href="assets/pdf/preprint_2024.pdf">pdf</a> of an old version).
* Conics on rational homogeneous spaces (with *[Nicolas Perrin](https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/nicolas.perrin/)*).
* Hyperbolicity of adjoint linear systems on spherical varieties (with *[Haesong Seo](https://sites.google.com/view/haesongseo/home)*).

Here is <a href="assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_Minseong_Kwon.pdf">my curriculum vitae</a>.
