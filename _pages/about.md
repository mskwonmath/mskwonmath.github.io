Welcome to my personal website!

I am Minseong Kwon, a graduate student at [Dept. of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/) in [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). I am also a student research assistant at [Center for Complex Geometry](https://ccg.ibs.re.kr/) in [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do). My PhD advisor is Prof. <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng/sub02_02_03.do">Jun-Muk Hwang</a>.

My research area is complex geometry and algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am interested in
* twistor spaces of quaternionic KÃ¤hler manifolds;
* complex contact geometry;
* deformation theory of rational curves in complex manifolds; and
* algebraic varieties with large symmetry, especially spherical varieties.

Currently, I am working on
* isotropy irreducible varieties and complex contact geometry (in preparation).
