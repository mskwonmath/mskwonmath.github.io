Welcome to my personal website!

I am Minseong Kwon, a graduate student of [Dept. of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/) in [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). I am also a student research assistant of [Center for Complex Geometry](https://ccg.ibs.re.kr/) in [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do).

My research area is complex geometry and algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am interested in

* twistor spaces of quaternionic KÃ¤hler manifolds;
* deformation theory of rational curves in projective manifolds; and
* algebraic varieties with large symmetry, including spherical varieties.
