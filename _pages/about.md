Welcome to the website of Minseong Kwon (권민성; 權玟成).

I will be a post-doctral researcher at *[Gyeongsang National University (경상국립대학교)](https://www.gnu.ac.kr/math/main.do)* from September 2025, mentored by *[Kyeong-Dong Park (박경동)](https://sites.google.com/view/kdpark)*.

I received my Ph.D. from *[KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/)* in August 2025, under the supervision of *[Jun-Muk Hwang (황준묵)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng/sub02_02_03.do)*. (Thesis title: Parameter spaces of conics in adjoint varieties and Luna-Vust theory; 뤼나-뷔스트 이론의 관점으로 본 수반 다양체의 이차곡선 매개변수공간.)

My research area is Lie-theoretic methods in complex geometry and in algebraic geometry. More specifically, I am interested in
* complex contact geometry;
* rational curves on complex manifolds; and
* spherical varieties.

The following papers are now in preparation:
* Conics on rational homogeneous spaces with *[Nicolas Perrin](https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/nicolas.perrin/)*.

Here is *<a href="assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae_Minseong_Kwon.pdf" target="_blank">my curriculum vitae</a>*.
